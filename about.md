I've wanted to have a place to share some of the projects that I'm working on in hopes of inspiring others, or to simply share the creative process. I learn by doing, and have been able to build some really cool things in large part due to people being generous with their time by writing up blog posts, creating YouTube videos, sharing code, and providing helpful comments in various forums.

I feel it's only right for me to share what I can in hopes it helps someone else in their explorations!

## Areas of exploration
* Electronic music - Ableton, Hardware Synths, MIDI, Max For Live development
* 3-D Printing - Setup, configuration, firmware, troubleshooting, hacking
* Electronics projects - Arduinio, XigBee, Raspberry Pi
* Photography and Design
* Brewing
* Building
* etc...
