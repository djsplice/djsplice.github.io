### CAN bus breakout boards - What, Why, How?
Over the past year or so, I've seen more and more people opt for adding a CAN enabled expansion board, typically to their tool head. The claim was that it would simplify wiring, eliminating a number of cables that extend from the main controller board to the extruder, hot-end, and end-stop switches.

While I was interested in simplifying my wiring situation, I'd always been a bit put off by what I perceived  to be some significant additional complexity in setting up a CAN enabled breakout board. Well, my wiring situation recently became a bit unstable and started to see some unexpected thermistor issues with my Rapido hot-end that I knew were attributed to too much stress on the cables. It was time to take the plunge.

Good news is, yes, my wiring from toolhead to main board is definitely cleaner/simpler. I'm down to 5 wires 2 for CAN, 2 for power, and 1 USB for my beacon probe...

Yes it was somewhat challenging to setup and configure, hopefully the information here helps others!

Yes I think it's a worthwhile modification, and would definitely do it again as part of my standard build.

Additional potholes:
- Re-crimping everything at the tool-head including: 
	- hot-end thermistor, heat block and cooling fan
	- direct drive stepper motor
	- end-stop switch
	- part cooling fans
- Creating a custom mount for the EBB36 breakout board. I use a custom EVA tool carriage, and surprise, the breakout board wouldn't fit conveniently on the back of the stepper motor as in typical setups. This included modifying the EVA backplate and strain relief bracket.

### Configuration / Setup Overview
1. Build Klipper with support for USB to CAN bus bridge *(no need for CanBoot on Octopus*)
2. Flash Octopus with updated klipper config
3. Update RaspberryPi with CAN network interface
4. Discover Octopus CAN bus UUID and update `printer.cfg`
5. Build CanBoot firmware for EBB36
6. Flash CanBoot onto EBB36
7. Create cabling to connect EBB36 to Octopus
8. Flash Klipper to EBB36 over CAN bus
9. Add EBB36 MCU to `printer.cfg`
10. Profit

#### What is CanBoot?
- CanBoot is firmware that allows one to install Klipper firmware over a CAN network
- You'll want to install CanBoot on CAN bus boards making it more convenient to install and upgrade Klipper firmware
	- Without it you would need to connect to the board via USB, boot the toolhead into DFU mode and Flash
	- With it you can flash from the RaspberryPi using the `flash_can.py` utility over the CAN bus network
- I didn't install CanBus on the Octopus, however, it may be helpful if you can flash it directly from the RaspberryPi (like EBB36), eliminating the need to do the SD Card shuffle... I haven't tested this idea yet!

### Create firmware with USB to CAN bus bridge support:

Original configuration:  [Klipper notes > Octopus Klipper config](../Klipper%20notes.md#Octopus%20Klipper%20config)

New configuration settings:
```
STMicroelectrnics STM32
STM32F446
32KiB Bootloader
12Mhz Clock
Communications for interface (USB to CAN bus bridge (USB on PA11/PA12))
CAN bus interface (CAN bus on (PD0/PD1))
(250000) CAN bus speed
make clean 
make
```

> [!USB and CAN Pins] 
> USB and CAN bus Pins can be found in [BIGTREETECH-OCTOPUS-V1.0 Â· GitHub](https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-OCTOPUS-V1.0/blob/master/Hardware/BIGTREETECH%20Octopus%20-%20PIN.pdf) 

> CAN bus speed should match all other CAN connected devices - changing from default 500000 to 250000
> There are several different STM32 processors on the Octopus - you should verify and ensure correct setting here...

### Flash Octopus with updated Firmware
1. Copy newly generated firmware from Raspberry Pi to a local computer
	1. `scp pi@mainsail.lmnt.local:/home/pi/klipper/out/klipper.bin ~/Downloads/`
2. Power off printer
3. Remove SD Card from Octopus
4. Connect SD Card to computer you copied the new firmware build to
6. Copy klipper.bin to SD Card and rename it to firmware.bin
8. Eject the SD Card and Put it back in Octopus board
9. Power on printer - wait

> [!NOTE] 
> At this point it will appear that things are no longer working, if you're really curious if the Firmware update worked, you'll have to shutdown the Octopus, take out the SD Card and see if the firmware.bin was deleted and replaced with a FIRMWARE.CUR
> 
> In order to reconnect things youll need to configure the RaspberryPI to talk to the board over the USB - CAN bridge instead of the  `/dev/serial/by-id/***`

### Configure Raspberry PI CAN interface

Create the can0 network interface: 

`sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0`

```
allow-hotplug can0
iface can0 can static
 bitrate 250000
 pre-up ip link set can0 type can bitrate 250000
 pre-up ip link set can0 txqueuelen 1024
 up ifconfig $IFACE txqueuelen 1024
```

Restart networking and ensure the CAN0 interface is up:

`sudo service networking restart`
`sudo ifup can0`

```
 $ ifconfig can0
can0: flags=193<UP,RUNNING,NOARP>  mtu 16
        unspec 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  txqueuelen 1024  (UNSPEC)
        RX packets 5973  bytes 44435 (43.3 KiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 832  bytes 4922 (4.8 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

Query CAN Network
```
cd /CanBoot/scripts
python3 flash_can.py -i can0 -q
```

>[!NOTE]
>At this point you may want to reboot the Raspberry Pi just to ensure that networking starts up as expected 

Update `printer.cfg` 

```
