## Fastest Prints


## Highest Quality Prints

### Perimeters and Top/Bottom layers
Nail down your Z-Offset otherwise you'll get elephants foot
- 4 Perimeters
- 5 Solid Top / Bottom Layers

Only one perimeter - On top surfaces
Overlapping external perimeters 100%

### Bridges
- Experimenting with 'Remove perimeters' on bridge areas, see if it improves bridge/wall quality in some scenarios like the top of the Z logo on the 30x30 calibration cube
- Enabled![Pasted image 20221213061237.png](../assets/images/Pasted%20image%2020221213061237.png) 

- Disabled

Changed Flow -> Bridge type
- Bridge flow baseline -> Keep current flow, Was set to nozzle diameter
- I thought it was creating a thicker layer - but superslicer crashed and defaulted to a different machine type
- Adjusted Bridge speed overhangs to 60% from 100%
-  Resulted in good overhang, cleanest print but it was using the wrong filament profile!!
	- Biggest change is EM set to .955 vs 1.04

Cube 4
- Used correct profile
- Re-set to nozzle diameter
- Adjusted Bridge line density min 80% max 100%
- Resulted in good overhangs, but slight over extrusion on top right of Z logo
	- Overhang layers slice at .4 and are connected

Cube 5
- Re-set to nozzle diameter
	- Overhang layers slice at .31 and have a slight gap between them
- Adjusted Bridge line density min 80% max 100%
- Adjusted temp to 220 from 230

### Layer Heights
First layer height .25
Base layer height .20
Slice resolution 0.002

Thicker layer heights makes overhangs easier to print

### Infill
Solid - Rectilinear (filled) - Connected
Top - Monotonic (filled) - Connected
- Can experiment with non-connected if [Small Infill Areas Look Overextruded | Ellisâ€™ Print Tuning Guide](https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/articles/troubleshooting/small_infill_areas_overextruded.html)

Retraction - Only retract when crossing perimeters

### Speed
Slowing down seemed to make the most improvements in quality. Here's my most current (12/13/22) speed settings
