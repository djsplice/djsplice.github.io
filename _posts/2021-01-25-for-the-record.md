Well, I'm back. After 2 strong posts in 2015, I've decided to give it another go! Strange thing is apparently I had the same exact feeling, on the same exact day, at nearly the same EXACT time in 2015...

I dusted off this Github Pages template, seeing if I could get Jekyll to do it's thing. I decided to copy one of my 2 original posts from back in the day and what do you know? The time stamp was `2015-01-25T09:58:34-08:00`. Now: `2021-01-25T09:13:00-08`
How funny.

Well, maybe in 2021 I'll top my record and write up 3 posts! Wish me luck.

Cheers!
